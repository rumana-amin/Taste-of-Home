## Project Summary
Taste of Home, an online frozen food venture, operated from late 2020 to 2023. As the managing partner overseeing business operations and responsible for transaction documentation, I initiated and executed a comprehensive project. This undertaking involves documenting transactions, creating accounting journals, maintaining a general ledger, generating profit and loss statements, crafting balance sheets, and analyzing sales data.
### Data Source
The dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from the "Journal[year].xlsx" file, encompassing detailed records of transactions conducted by Taste of Home. The file consists of multiple sheets, including Journal, General Ledger, Profit and Loss (PL), Balance Sheet, Statement of Equity, Sales Details, and more.
